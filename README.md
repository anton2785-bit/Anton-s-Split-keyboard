# Images
* This image inspired me for the layout for the keyboard

* These are both sides of the keyboard in the shematic tab in kicad

* This is the final PCB wiring

* This is the case, that i made

* And this is the whole assembly

# Instructions of how to assemble
* First solder all of the diodes, keyboard switches, LEDs, Microcontrollers and batteries
* Second place the now assembled PCB in the case and connect it to a computer via USB C cable
* Third you need to upload the Firmware on the microcontrollers
* And finally you need to put all of the keycaps and test the keyboard

---
# Use cases 
* For me ill try to learn how to type faster on diffrent keyboard, because i now use the slower methouds for typing
